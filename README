DataStax downloader
--------------------

The DataStax Downloader is designed to allow for quick download and configuration of DataStax products for simple testing.
It will not generate clusters for you.

The DataStax downloader will download a tarball version of the DataStax product specified
(DataStax Community, DataStax Enterprise, DataStax OpsCenter)

After downloading the tarball, that tarball will then be extracted and the configuration files will be edited to run the product within
the storage directory.

A configuration file is required to specify where to place the extracted files as well as for credential 
verification.

SETUP
-------------------

Edit the getdatastax.cfg to include your DataStax download credentials
These are needed for downloading DSE only

Example:


```
username=Maurice.moss_reynholm.com
pwd=0118_999_881_999_119_725_3
```

The datastax_dir is the path to where you want the files to be stored. This directory does not need to exist.
If it does not, the datastax-downloader will create it for you. Within this directory will be a separate
directory for each of the products

$datastax_dir/enterprise
$datastax_dir/community
$datastax_dir/opscenter

Please be sure to put the leading and trailing single quote (') as well as the trailing slash (/)
This is how it was written to use the path so you need to format it this way 

Example:

`datastax_dir='/home/sequoyha/DataStax/'`

After you have made the changes, rename the file to .getdatastax.cfg and place it in your home directory

Create a symbolic link to the get-datastax file in the datastax-downloader directory

```
$ sudo ln -s ~/path/to/datastax-downloader/get-datastax /usr/local/bin/get-datastax
```

To run:
-----------------

```
$ get-datastax <product_code> <version_number>
```

Product codes:

dse: DataStax Enterprise
dsc: DataStax Community
ops: OpsCenter

The version number is always a 3 part number. 

So, to download Cassandra 1.2.12, execute the following:

```
$ get-cassandra dsc 1.2.12
```

You will see output similar to :

```
$ get-cassandra dsc 1.2.12

Editing cassandra.yaml and logging file to write to /your/configured/path/
Done.
```

Once it is downloaded you can switch to the $datastax_dir/product/version/bin directory to run.

Enjoy.
